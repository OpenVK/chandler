# Chandler
Chandler is PHP-based web-framework/web-portal. By itself it's pretty useless, but you can install plugins/apps.

# Plugins
Plugins may provide a Web Application or be a library or hook.
Web Apps are mounted to a path like this: `/<id>` (where `id = app id`), but one app can be mounted to root.

# State of this repo
This product is still in development phase, we are currently writing documentation/tests and API is going to change.
